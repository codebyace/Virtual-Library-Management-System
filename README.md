Objective: 

The Virtual Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows admins and students to manage library resources effectively. The system enables students to access the library data by registering or logging in to their accounts. Admins have the ability to manage the books and students' accounts. The system supports adding, editing, and viewing books, as well as managing student accounts, issuing books, and handling fines.

Overview: The application is developed in C++ and does not utilize classes, pointers, or structures. It makes use of 2D arrays, functions, loops, if-else statements, and switch cases to achieve the intended functionality. The main() function manages user input, offers options to the user, and invokes the corresponding functions based on the user's chosen option. The program operates in a loop until the user opts to exit.


Admin Features:
  1. Add a book to the system: The administrator has the ability to include new titles in the library's collection.  
  2. Edit the book details: The administrator can modify the title and author of a book by using its ISBN.  
  3. View book status: The administrator can check the list and availability of books within the library.  
  4. View registered students: The administrator can access the list of students enrolled in the system, arranged by their roll numbers.  
  5. View student account balance: The administrator can inspect the account balance of an individual student.

User Features:
  1. Create an account: A new student can sign up by entering their roll number, name, and initial deposit amount.
  2. View balance: Students can check their account balance.  
  3. Deposit amount: Students can add funds to their accounts.  
  4. Issue a book: Students are allowed to borrow books from the list of available titles.


This project is ideal for students who have finished a Programming Fundamentals course or lab and wish to showcase their C++ programming skills without incorporating advanced concepts like classes or pointers. It establishes a robust basis for further learning and growth in C++ and software development.
